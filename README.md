# Multi Genre Symbolic Music Generation using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network

This work has been presented at 2nd International Conference on Data Science and Intelligent Applications (ICDSIA-2023)

## Introduction 

DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network) is a deep learning model that consists of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates new data samples, while the discriminator distinguishes between the generated samples and real samples from the training dataset. Through a competitive process, the generator learns to create more realistic data samples, while the discriminator becomes better at distinguishing between the two types of data. GANs have various applications, such as image synthesis, natural language processing, and music generation.

In this work we have used DCGAN and trained it to generate music of different genres i.e. Trap, Slaphouse, R&B, Trance&Techno and Latin music. Niko Dance MIDI pack and Cymantic Pandora MIDI pack was used as a training set for the model.
